# Overview

Zapp.ie is an innovative solution that seamlessly integrates into Microsoft Teams and leverages Microsoft Copilot to create a dynamic, value-driven ecosystem of collaboration. Through a combination of AI automation and Bitcoin micro-transactions, Zapp.ie enables users, copilots (AI agents), and even customers to engage in meaningful interactions that drive success.

With Zapp.ie, users, copilots, and customers can:

- Send and receive Bitcoin-based rewards (Sats) as a token of appreciation for helping reach goals—whether from teammate to teammate, teammate to copilot, teammate to customer, or even copilot to copilot.
- Reinforce positive behaviors and effective workflows through microtransactions based on real value, enhancing both AI copilots’ learning and motivating teammates and customers to adopt the right ways of working.
- Enable both teammates and copilots to fund their own development by earning and utilizing rewards to further their personal and professional growth.

Zapp.ie transforms traditional incentives into a powerful, value-for-value system where AI copilots, human teammates, and customers work together, driving continuous improvement and engagement in a transparent, rewarding manner.

# Getting Started with Zapp.ie

Zapp.ie integrates directly with Microsoft Teams to enhance collaboration and recognition through Bitcoin micro-transactions and AI-powered automation. Here’s how you can get started and use Zapp.ie effectively with your team:

## Prerequisite to starting development

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 18
- A Microsoft 365 tenant in which you have permission to upload Teams apps (where other developers have not been deploying the same bot with a matching ID). You may be able to get a free Microsoft 365 developer tenant by joining the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program). However, it seems recently Microsoft have removed this offering other than to users who have a Visual Studio Enterprise subscription, (see [Creating a Free Microsoft 365 Dev Tenant is Not Possible](https://o365reports.com/2024/03/14/creating-a-free-microsoft-365-e5-developer-tenant-is-no-longer-possible/)) and now advise creating a "single-license development tenant" (see steps in `Wiki` > `Setup` > `Microsoft development tenant`).
- [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [TeamsFx CLI](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit-cli). You should be prompted to install this when you open the solution in VS Code.
- [LNbits](https://www.lnbits.com) version 0.12 or higher. NB For development you can use the developer instance specified in `.env.dev`, or create your own instance, as specified in `Wiki` > `Setup` > `LNbits`.

> Note: If you are using node 20, you can add following snippet in package.json to remove the warning of incompatibility. (Related discussion: https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-js/issues/4550)

```
"overrides": {
  "@azure/msal-node": "^2.6.0"
}
```
